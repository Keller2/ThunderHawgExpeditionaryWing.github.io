        <h3>Taipuran Citizens</h3>
        <p> The people of Taipura have faced political tension since thier seperation from the
            state of Shendao in the early 1900s. As a result the people have grown annoyed with any sort of foreign intervention
            but still remain friendly to US forces because of thier help in WWII. In the past Taipura has had allies abandon
            thier cause in order to protect thier own interests which has left the Taipuran people struggling to trust other nations.
            When interacting with the Taipurans you must have a way to gain their trust before asking anything of them. Once you have
            earned thier trust they are more than willing to cooperate with you. If this trust is broken there is almost no way
            of earning it back. Some ways to earn thier trust are: helping them with favors, trading, listening to thier stories.
